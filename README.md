# Hello Raspberry Pi

## Description
For this assignment we watched a video instructing us on the basics of using a raspberry pi and were instructed to write out the classic lines of code “Hello World” in a variety of new ways. 

## Revelations

*The Raspberry Pi is completely independent of your computer while programming, the computer screen only acts as a means of communication.
*There’s no need to save code every time your done coding as it’s all automatically saved by the RP(Raspberry Pi).
*The interface of Putty and git Bash are incredibly similar with only some major commands changed or added.
